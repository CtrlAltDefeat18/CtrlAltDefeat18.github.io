        <p>Aphelele Mjobo is an IT: Systems Development student at the EBL Institute of Technology and a postgraduate student in enterprise management at Rhodes University, driven by a mission to build scalable, offline-first digital education tools for underserved communities.

      <h3>Luthando David</h3>
      <p><strong>Co-Founder</strong></p>
      <div id="bio-luthando" class="bio-collapse">
        <p>Luthando David is a Bachelor of Arts graduate in Legal Theory and History from Rhodes University, currently furthering their studies through a Postgraduate Diploma in Enterprise Management. Passionate about youth empowerment, education equity, and ethical leadership, Luthando is committed to building inclusive systems that prioritise people, potential, and purpose. Throughout their undergraduate journey, Luthando held key leadership roles — serving as Head Student of Residence and as part of the Student Representative Council projects team — where they led community-building initiatives that brought together students across diverse backgrounds. As a Philosophy Department tutor, they supported academic growth and critical thinking, mentoring students through complex content and reflective learning. Luthando is also actively involved in the Peer Educator Programme, using dialogue and peer support to promote holistic student wellness and mental health awareness on campus. Their commitment to social impact extends to community-level initiatives such as digital equity work through Close the Gap. With a growing interest in organisational change, ethical entrepreneurship, and sustainable development, Luthando sees enterprise as a powerful tool for social transformation.</p>

      <h3>Unathi Gongxeka</h3>
      <p><strong>Co-Founder & Financial Manager</strong></p>
      <div id="bio-unathi" class="bio-collapse">
        <p>Unathi is currently pursuing a Postgraduate Diploma in Enterprise Management at Rhodes University, she brings a blend of academic insight and real-world experience to her evolving professional journey. Before returning to academia, she worked as a Junior HR Business Partner at Standard Bank Group, where she developed a strong foundation in talent management. This transition marks her second academic chapter at Rhodes University, having previously earned a Bachelor of Social Sciences Honours degree in Politics and International Studies. Stepping away from the corporate has allowed her to reflect deeply on the kind of impactful work she would like to be part of. This period of introspection led her to explore roles that align with purpose-driven impact, such as career guidance for high school scholars, where she can blend her HR background with a passion for youth development. What draws me to Close The Gap as an emerging NPO is its commitment to closing the digital divide, particularly in an economic context that increasingly demands digital literacy and skills. I admire its inclusive approach to empowering underserved communities—both in rural and urban settings—by ensuring access to the tools, knowledge, and opportunities needed to participate meaningfully in the digital economy. Outside of work and study, she enjoys hiking, reading, and embracing experiences that foster growth and connection. A quote that she lives by is : “ The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.” by Mahatma Gandhi</p>
